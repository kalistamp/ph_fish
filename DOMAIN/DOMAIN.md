### Getting a Domain:

A domain name needs to be convincing and similar enough to the domain of the legitimate website. One can use [urlcrazy](https://github.com/urbanadventurer/urlcrazy) or [catphish](https://github.com/ring0lab/catphish) to generate a list of typo domains.

After running URLCRAZY you will see a Full list of all Typo Domains that were discovered. The domains with the question-mark are ones we can choose from... The rest are in use and not available. 

URLCRAZY Setup:

``` 
git clone https://github.com/urbanadventurer/urlcrazy.git
cd urlcrazy
sudo -s
gem install bundler
bundle install
urlcrazy therecap.org
```

Search Expired Domains for a now available, high reputation domain. ExpireDomains is in essence a garbage bin that shows you how much value a discarded domain has... a wonderful resource to the adversaries:
