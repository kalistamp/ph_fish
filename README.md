### Phishing Basics:

The basic idea behind phishing is to create a copy of login or whole website and allow user to login so as to save account credentials. 


[ex.] an attacker creates a copy of gmail page, which exactly looks similar to the original, but coded in a way that it will store credentials whenever someone tries to login through that page. Now the attacker will share the link of his phising page somehow (through mails, messages, web links, etc.) and attacker has all the credentials of all the users who tried to login through phishing page.
