### Phishing Basics:

The basic idea behind phishing is to create a copy of a login page or whole website and allow user to login so that you can obtain the account credentials. 


[ex.] an attacker creates a copy of gmail page, which exactly looks similar to the original, but coded in a way that it will store credentials whenever someone tries to login through that page. Now the attacker will share the link of his phising page somehow (through mails, messages, web links, etc.) and attacker has all the credentials of all the users who tried to login through phishing page.

### Types of Phishing:

* Spear Phishing - 

Spear-phishing, as with throwing a physical spear; you’d have a target to aim at, the same can be said with spear-phishing in that you’re targeting an individual, business or organisation rather than just anybody as mass. This is an effective form of phishing for a red team engagement as they are bespoke to the target it makes them hard to detect by technology such as spam filters, antivirus and firewalls.
