### Phishing Basics:

The basic idea behind phishing is to create a copy of a login page or whole website and allow user to login so that you can obtain the account credentials. 


[ex.] an attacker creates a copy of gmail page, which exactly looks similar to the original, but coded in a way that it will store credentials whenever someone tries to login through that page. Now the attacker will share the link of his phising page somehow (through mails, messages, web links, etc.) and attacker has all the credentials of all the users who tried to login through phishing page.

### Types of Phishing:

* Spear Phishing - 

Spear-phishing, as with throwing a physical spear; you’d have a target to aim at, the same can be said with spear-phishing in that you’re targeting an individual, business or organisation rather than just anybody as mass. This is an effective form of phishing for a red team engagement as they are bespoke to the target it makes them hard to detect by technology such as spam filters, antivirus and firewalls.

* Whale Phishing
* Smishing (SMS)

### Set-Up:

Three  things to work with regarding phishing emails - Sender’s email address | the subject | and the content

* The Senders Address:

(  Run your email through a spam filter first, It is very easy to detect phishing or spamming context, Big mail providers like gmail often have pretty good filters, target companies - Use good SMTP )

Sending a Trusted source that the victim will feel comfortable clicking on is important,
Ideally, the sender’s address would be from a domain name that spoofs a significant brand, a known contact, or a coworker.

To find what brands or people a victim interacts with, you can employ OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tactics. For example:

Observe their social media account for any brands or friends they talk to. Searching Google for the victim’s name and rough location for any reviews the victim may have left about local businesses or brands. Looking at the victim’s business website to find suppliers. Looking at LinkedIn to find coworkers of the victim.

* The Subject:

You should set the subject to something quite urgent, worrying, or piques the victim’s curiosity, so they do not ignore it and act on it quickly.

[ex.] Your account has been compromised.
Your package has been dispatched/shipped.
Staff payroll information (do not forward!)
Your photos have been published.

* The Content:
