Q:

I've been phishing for quite some time now and have nearly 100k emails either scraped or taken from fresh databases as well as multiple realistic website clones. Everything has been smooth-sailing until like a week ago when despite me sending the email to 5k people, i got like 2 results. this was when i found out that every single one of my emails are going to the recipients spam. I've made multiple different emails, used  a vpn, proxies, virtual machines and different mail providers but despite all that every single email that has more than 30 recipients is going to spam.. whats the issue??

A:

* one advice : target new areas/countries, less targeted.

* I recommend that you only target a specific country on each email and add a few seconds delay for each delivery. Don't send too many emails should be limited but i think you need many SMTP for send it LoL

* Run your email through a spam filter first, It is very easy to detect phishing or spamming context.

you will need to change the content.

* Big mail providers like gmail often have pretty good filters, target companies

* filter by domain (gmail,yahoo,hotmail) and then filter by country. use good smtp
