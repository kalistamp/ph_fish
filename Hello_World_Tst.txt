* Obtained a Domain from Freenom (http://raymondspizzeria.cf/) 
    #Chose to grab a domain from Freenom instead of AWS Route 53 even tho i will be using most AWS for this first tester campaign 

* Created AWS Account for cloud - rroadrunner @ proton

* Favorite an AWS EC2 Instance (This is pretty much just a dedicated aws server)
    #Ec2 is the erver out victims will be connecting too

* Favorite an AWS S3 Bucket to receive emails back to our Domain we get earlier from Freenom 
    #If the victim responds back to our phishing email, you will be able to read the contents of there reply here
    
* Create my first EC2 Instance - 
           #Choose which type of Server you want to host this Instance: ( Canonical, Ubuntu, 22.04 LTS, amd64 jammy image build on 2022-06-09 )
           
           #Choose the type of instance: ( t.2.micro )
                 
           #Create a Key-Pair for your Instance and give it a name (.pem file): "ray_pizza"
           This key pair will be used later when it is time to SSH into our server
           
           #REVIEW SUMMARY OF YOUR INSTANCE BEFORE FINALLY LAUNCHING IT ...
           
           # SUMMARY:
           Software Image (AMI)
           Canonical, Ubuntu, 22.04 LTS, ...read more
           ami-085284d24fe829cd0
           Virtual server type (instance type)
           t2.micro
           Firewall (security group)
           New security group
           Storage
           1 volume(s) - 8 GiB
           
           # After Instance is succesfully launched you will be given an Instance ID number for confirmation: (i-099d3b79cdb74ec2d)

* NEXT We are going to Configure "security groups" for the new instance that we just created (ray_pizza). 
            #Security groups are going to let you regulate which ports you decide to leave open or closed on the server.
            
            #Click on "Create new Security Group", Go into "Indbound Rules", "Add Rule"
            - First we are going to create an open port that we can later SSH into:
            Type:
            Custom TCP
            Protocol: 
            TCP
            Port range: 
            22
            Source type:
            Anywhere-IPv4
            Source: 
            0.0.0.0/0
            Description: 
            SSh

            - Next Rule we will change the "type" to "Custon UDP", and open port to allow DNS to work on our server:
            Type:
            Custom UDP
            Protocol: 
            UDP
            Port range: 
            53
            Source type:
            Anywhere-IPv4
            Source 
            0.0.0.0/0
            Description: 
            Dns
            
            -
