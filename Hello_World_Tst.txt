* Obtained a Domain from Freenom (http://raymondspizzeria.cf/) 
    #Chose to grab a domain from Freenom instead of AWS Route 53 even tho i will be using most AWS for this first tester campaign 

* Created AWS Account for cloud - rroadrunner @ proton

* Create an AWS EC2 Instance (This is pretty much just a dedicated aws server)
    #Ec2 is the erver out victims will be connecting too

* Create an AWS S3 Bucket to receive emails back to our Domain we get earlier from Freenom 
    #If the victim responds back to our phishing email, you will be able to read the contents of there reply here

AWS Will not let me access ec2 because it is verifying my account still smh - - - 

It might take up to 24 hours to fully activate your AWS services. If you canâ€™t access your services after that time, contact support.
